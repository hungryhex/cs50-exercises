## Thoughts üí≠

I enrolled in this course so that I could gain a deeper understanding of the computer science world and of programming itself. So far, I am really enjoying it. David Malan is a superb lecturer.

## Notes üìù

I have also included my personal notes for each week's lecture.

See [NOTES](NOTES.md).

> PASS-THE-BALL.sb3

A game which requires user keyboard input to help 'Mike' pass the ball back and forth to 'Jordan'. This was a simple interactive 'game' I made using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), so that I could learn the basic building blocks of programs.
